# Ghost Utils

:bulb: This repository is now part of the main [Ghost monorepo](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost). The individual packages now live at [/ghost/](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/main/ghost). 

[Contributing to Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) is now much easier with everything in one place. Hope to see you in the monorepo :wave:
